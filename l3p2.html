<p>
First, formatting pages so that they are printer-friendly can be very important to the user. It can be quite 

frustrating sometimes when a page does not have a printer friendly version for printing. Here are something I learned 

when creating pages that might need to be printed out. Use Serif type font. Font size should never be smaller than 

12pt. Always use black font and white background with no images. Remove navigation, ads, and special effects. Make sure 

to display the original URL for later reference. 
</p>
<p>
Second, using CSS style when creating HTML documents is many advantages. External sheets are great for creating one 

style to apply to all documents on a website. This will help to ensure that the page looks professional and 

streamlined. When you need to change something on your document, you can usually just make changes in your style tag 

instead of every location effected in the document. CCS has document sheets that will style the specific document you 

are creating. Inline sheets allow you to style a specific area in the document. 
</p>
<p>
Lastly, set up the sizes on your document so that it can be viewed on multiple devices to include mobile devices. When 

deciding what font size you would like to display specifying the font size as, let's say, 12pt or small will create 

problems for users when they try to view the page on their phone. Using relative font sizes such as a percentage or em 

allows the font to size itself accordingly. Also, when defining the height and width of an image or box, it is 

important to use percent when defining the size.
